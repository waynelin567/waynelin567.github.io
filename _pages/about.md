- I will start my Ph.D. studies at UC Berkeley from 2020 Fall.  
- I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in 2019. My undergrad research advisors were professor [Iris Hui-Ru Jiang](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1?id=1060726) and professor [Shao-Yi Chien](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile?id=101).
